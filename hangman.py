The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch, But that the sea, mounting to the welkin cheek, Dashes the fire out. O, I have sufferedWith those that I saw suffer: a brave vessel,Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her, Dash'd all to pieces. O, the cry did knockAgainst my very heart. Poor souls, they perishd. Had I been any god of power, I wouldHave sunk the sea within the earth or ere It should the good ship so have swallow andThe fraughting souls within her."
